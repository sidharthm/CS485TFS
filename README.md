CS485TFS
========

Final project for CS485

Hi,

Good evening!

Our part 1 assumes a single server. We didn't code any TCP connection so client connects to master and vice versa automatically.

To do the tests, we follow the professor's input parameters. You can also input '?' to have the show parameters of the tests.

If the number of arguments entered is not equal to expected we just print out the console automatically, not executing anything. On the other hand, if test doesn't exist, it would be invalid.

Our print statements are not very clear but hope they do help you in understanding what's happening in the program.

The TFS will always continue from last executed action until log.txt is cleared.

** We were having a hard time reading backslashes for the TFS system, so we just read forward slashes for now. If you do enter backward slashes, program will return errors even if directory does exist. 
	eg. Test2 1/2 3, Test3 1/2/4, Test4 C:\My Documents\Pic.png 1/2/File1.png
   We know it can get confusing especially for test 4 - 6. Sorry and we'll be sure to fix this for part 2.
   

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Emily, Ganesh, Jillian, Sid
